## Why?
Did you know that more than 250 000 web pages are published every day? The majority of them uses too heavy fonts, too large/unnecessary images or utilizes redundant libraries. These factors, and more, generate carbon footprint. Actually, one view of an average website generates 4.6 g CO2, which amounts to 552 kg CO2 annually (10 000 monthly views on average). Unfortunately, current solutions optimize only already existing websites.

ec0lint is a static code analysis tool that provides users with hints on how to reduce the carbon footprint of their websites during the development process. Applying code changes suggested by ec0lint results in lower carbon emissions per visit, quicker loading and higher space efficiency. The tool is open-source and community-driven.
